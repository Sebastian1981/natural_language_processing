# Natural Language_Processing - Topic Modeling API
The purpose is to build a FLASK API to detect topics for given articles. We start experimentally developing the model using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach based on Bayesian statistics. (check out the "topic_modeling.ipynb"). The training data contains over 1.000 different english articles covering various topics.
